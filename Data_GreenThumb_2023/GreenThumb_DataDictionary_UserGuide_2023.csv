","GreenThumb provides programming and material support to over 550 community gardens in New York City. 

Garden Info: The data contains garden characteristics, features and amenities. Open hours are subject to change.

Block - Lots: Block and lot associated with the Greenthumb garden. A ParksID may be associated with several BBLs.

Site Visits: NYC Parks GreenThumb staff visit all active community gardens under the jurisdiction of NYC Parks once each calendar year, subject to staff capacity.  These site visits typically occur during the summer months and representatives of licensed garden groups are invited to attend.  During these site visits, NYC Parks GreenThumb staff observe and record quantitative and qualitative information related to the physical status of the garden, as well as its ongoing operation, maintenance, and programming.  This information is used by NYC Parks GreenThumb to inform maintenance needs at the garden and to help NYC Parks GreenThumb understand the needs of garden groups so that we can plan accordingly.  In addition, this information is necessary for NYC Parks GreenThumb to confirm that publicly accessible community gardens under its jurisdiction are being operated in safe manner and in accordance with the NYC Parks GreenThumb License Agreement and applicable NYS and NYC laws and regulations.  NYC Parks GreenThumb may conduct additional site visits as deemed necessary.
 
The data about garden location and open hours is presented visually on the GreenThumb Garden Map (https://greenthumb.nycgovparks.org/gardensearch.php), where users can search for community gardens."
